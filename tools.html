	        	<h3>C++</h3>
	        	<p>
				C++ is an object-oriented language and an extension of C. It is an intermediate language that contains features from low and high level languages.
				C++ will be used to preprocess the image and create a more manageable data set to use in a Neural Network algorithm. C++ will also handle the post 
				processing of the image and convert the initial processed data back into a Hi-res image with the new data</p>
				<h3>OpenCV</h3>
				<p>
				OpenCV is an open source machine learning software library. The library contains more than 2500 optimized algorithms that can be used to detect faces, identify objects, 
				track camera movements, stitch images together, and many others. It contains interfaces for C++, C, Python, Java, and MATLAB and is supported on Windows, Mac OS, and Linux. 
				OpenCV will ease the interaction between C++ and Python and allow us to incorporate machine learning algorithms into our program. Specifically from the Machine Learning 
				library in OpenCV we will be focusing on using Neural Network classes.</p>
				<h3>Boost.Python</h3>
				<p>
				Boost.Python is a C++ library that enables ease of interaction between C++ and Python. The library includes support for C++ to Python exception translation, 
				manipulating Python objects in C++, and exporting C++ iterators as Python iterators. It allows developers to easily expose C++ class functions and objects to Python as 
				well as the other way around. This library will help us incorporate both languages into the same project</p>
	        	</div>
				
				<div class="col-md-4">
	        	<h3>Python and Pycharm IDE</h3>
	        	<p>
				Python is a powerful and fast language that can be incorporated well with other languages and systems. Python syntax is easy to learn and read, 
				which in turn can reduce the cost of program maintenance. The IDE our team will be using for Python during the development of this project will be Pycharm. 
				Unlike other text editors that only do syntax highlighting, the Pycharm IDE is aware of all of Pythonâ€™s language rules and code structure. 
				Pycharm also comes with many useful features that include code navigation, autocomplete, integrated debugging, integrated unit tests, clickable stack traces, and many more.
				The Neural Network algorithm that will handle the Image Pattern Recognition will be implemented in Python.</p>
				<h3>Github</h3>
				<p>
				Github is an online Git repository service offering all of the distributed version control and source code management. Github also provides access control and collaboration 
				features which include bug tracking, feature requests, and task management. The source code for our project shall be available through Github initially maintained by Team strata. 
				Once the Image Pattern Recognition program is completed, the Github repository will be transferred over to the sponsor Dr. Ryan Anderson.
