                <h1>Functional Requirements</h1>

                <h3>HiRISE and CTX</h3>
                    <p>The system shall use the data sets provided by the HiRISE and the CTX
                        instruments as the primary input for the tool. These datasets are provided to the
                        public as JPEG2000 (JP2) images. As a consequence, any preprocessing
                        of the
                        images will require adherence to JP2 specifications.</p>
                       <p> a. The HiRISE (High Resolution Imaging Science Experiment) provides high
                        resolution (25 cm/pixel) images of Marsâ€™ surface.</p>
                       <p> b. The CTX (context camera) provides a more general overview of the surface
                        at 6m/pixel.</p>
                <h3>Mars Orbital Datasets</h3>
                    <p>
                        The system shall allow users to be able to load and georeference multiple Mars
                        orbital datasets, identify terrain types and features, and automatically map similar
                        features across multiple input images.
                    </p>
                <h3>Image Mapping</h3>
                    <p>
                    The system shall use HiRISE and CTX to present three Reduced Data Record
                    (RDR) products conforming to Planetary Data System (PDS) standards.</p>
                   <p> a. HiRISE consists of two distinct RDRs. The first being a singlecolor
                    RDR
                    created from redfiltered
                    cameras with a pixel width of 20,048. The second is a
                    threecolor
                    product which is a composite of red, bluegreen,
                    and nearinfrared
                    cameras with a pixel width of 4,048. Image data shall be combined to maximize
                    available dataset.</p>
                    <p>b. In contrast to HiRISE, the CTX camera has a comparably lower
                    resolution.This necessitates a manytoone
                    and onetomany
                    mapping algorithm
                    to associate pixel information between the HiRISE and CTX RDRs.
                    </p>
                <h3>Artificial Neural Network</h3>
                    <p>
                        Due to the size and complexity of input RDRs, the system shall use an Artificial
                        Neural Network (ANN) in order to minimize time required to map terrain types. A
                        Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) which is the neural network often used for
                        image recognition and that served as the inspiration for this project. [3]
            
                        CNNs are multilayer perceptrons that mimic visual perception by overlapping
                        information segments. This also minimizes the need for image preprocessing.
                        The ability to supervise training of the neural network layer by layer has made the
                        CNN the prime candidate to implement neural network functionality required by
                        the sponsor.
                    </p>
                <h3>Training Datasets</h3>
                    <p>
                        CNNs are a type of feedforward
                        neural network, though powerful, they require
                        relatively large datasets to adequately train the neural network on. To circumvent
                        this issue, the system shall need tools to generate realistic and reliably labelled
                        training datasets as the initial training dataset provided by the sponsor will be
                        small. Mimicry of training datasets will shall utilize the following techniques
                        stochastic downsampling, orientation inversion, and image reorganization.
                                            </p>
                <h3>Image Post-Processing</h3>
                    <p>The system shall use side channel spatial information such as transparency and
                        alpha planes, which are useful for transmitting information for processing the
                        image for display, print, or editing. This will be utilized to maintain neural network
                        predictions inside the output RDR, such as marking the area of interest in the
                        transparency plane, without compromising the input RDR.</p> 
                <h3>Algorithm Performance</h3>
                    <p>The system shall be able to assess how well the algorithm performed by
                        comparing the correctness of the identified terrain with the results of a
                        humangenerated
                        map.</p>
                <h3>Robustness</h3>
                    <p>
                        The system shall be designed to handle error conditions easily, without failure.
                        Such conditions include a tolerance of invalid datasets (non HiRISE/CTX
                        produced data sets), unexpected operating conditions, and overfitting within
                        machine learning algorithms.
                    </p>
